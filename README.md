#  Homework: Automatic segmentation of Prostate and Prostate peripheral zone (PZ) from MRI images

## Introduction
In this homework we will solve another interesting health related problem using deep learning. 
The objective is to build a model that can automatically segment the prostate and 
the prostate peripheral zone (PZ) from MRI images.

The dataset was obtained from [MedicalDecathlon](https://medicaldecathlon.com/) and
it is already at our shared blue folder on HiperGator at `/blue/isc5935/share/datasets/Decathlon/Task05_Prostate`

The dataset only contains 32 MRIs (T2, ADC) of the prostate and the prostate peripheral zone (PZ) for training,
and 16 images for testing. The images are in the NIfTI format.

Specific objectives for this homework are to:
1. Apply what we have learned about CNNs to solve a segmentation problems
2. Continue using TensorBoard to visualize the training process
3. Obtain experience on solving problems using deep learning from real data

## Submission
You need to create a folder inside your personal `blue shared` folder. There you will upload your code.

The folder should be named `HM_Segmentation` and it should contain the following files:
- `main.ipynb`: A python script that will run your project and contain the description of your project. 
- `MyGenerator.py`: A python script that will load the data.
- `train.py`: A python script that will train your model.
- `model.py`: A python script that will define your model.

### Visualize the data (10 pts)
In your `main.ipynb` make a cell or cells that displays four example cases from the training set. 

Each figure should have the following information:
- The T2 image
- The ADC shape
- The T2 image with the segmentation overlayed (use a different color for each class)

### Dataset and preprocessing (10 pts)
Create a PyTorch dataset **MyGenerator.py** that loads the data.

Inside your constructor you should receive at least the *input_folder* and the *transform* to apply to each of the samples.
Please design a method that splits the data into training and validation sets and describe it in your README file.

Please describe your approach for reading the data and preprocessing it. 
Are you using both modalities (T2 and ADC) or just one of them?

How are you predicting the segmentation for both classes (prostate and PZ)?
Some options:
- Separate the segmentation into two classes (binary segmentation) by channels
- Predict the segmentation for both classes at the same time (multi-class segmentation). In this case the loss can detect which
class are you predicting and compute the loss function accordingly.
- Make two different models, one for each class.

Suggested transformations:
- Resize the images to same spacing
- Crop the images from the center to a predefined size (e.g. 256x256x256)
- Normalize the images to have zero mean and unit variance
 
Tip 1: we only have 32 MRI images for training, so you should use a small validation set.

### Model design (10 pts)
The suggested model to implement is a version of the [3D U-Net](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.06650.pdf%E4%BB%A3%E7%A0%81%E5%9C%B0%E5%9D%80%EF%BC%9Ahttps://github.com/wolny/pytorch-3dunet).

But you are free to use any other model that you think is appropriate for this problem.
Please describe with words your proposed model architecture. 
Feel free to include an image of the proposed architecture (from tensorboard or any other tool).

Suggested architecture components:
- 3D convolutional layers
- 3D max pooling layers
- 3D upsampling layers
- 3D batch normalization layers
- 3D residual blocks

### Model training and tensorboard (10 pts)
Create a **train.py** script that will train your model.

The suggested loss function for this segmentation problems is the [SÃ¸rensenâ€“Dice coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%B8rensen%E2%80%93Dice_coefficient),
it can be implemented using the [torchmetrics](https://torchmetrics.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library or manually. 

In you training script you should:
- Iterate by a number of epochs and batches, and evaluate the model on the validation set at the end of each epoch.
- Create a tensorboard writer and save the following information for each epoch:
    - Training loss
    - Validation loss
    - A sample of the validation images (2) and the predicted segmentations. 
    - Additionally, save the model graph for the first epoch
- Keep track of the model with the lowest validation loss and save it to disk.

### Model integration (10 pts)
Create a **main.py** file or notebook that will have the general structure of a PyTorch project.
Here you will call your dataset, data loader, model, and training script.

Here you can also include the transformations that you will apply to the data.

### Describe results (10 pts)
Describe the results of your model. Include the following information:
- What is the best validation loss you got?
- Show screenshots of your results from tensorboard. 
- Include a screenshot of the graph and the images. And discuss your results.
 
### Extra credit (10 pts)
- Increase your training dataset from other sources. 
- You can use the [NIH Chest X-ray dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/nih-chest-xrays/data) or the [MIMIC-CXR dataset](https://physionet.org/content/mimic-cxr/2.0.0/).
